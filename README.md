# saveSync
ðŸ’¾ **Manage and back up your save games with GitHub.**

This readme was written for commit [f2d4bf3](https://github.com/z2oh/saveSync/commit/f2d4bf38a809df6d4b8a7d9b8ce58a6f01d0194b) and may only reflect the state of the code at the time of that commit.

The project is currently in pre-alpha and has no functionality. Only the most basic tooling has been set up.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/z2oh/saveSync.git && cd saveSync && npm install && npm start
```

## Features
### Current
* Literally none!

### Planned
Planned features are included in roughly the order that they will be implemented. These features will be split up into feature request issues to be tackled at a later date.
* Create a save-game git repository on a user's GitHub account
* Allow user to choose files and folder to sync to the save-game repository
* Metadata allows for saveSync to easily put files and folders in the right place
* Management of save games (revert to previous save, delete save, etc.) and a well designed interface for access to these fatures
* Automatic detection of changes in saves to automatically sync
* Automatic detection of game saves for multiple games in their default locations
